## How to address controls with 'parent' & 'children' in Lua

![moving faders](address_controls.gif)

This template shows you how to address controls with
'parent' & 'children' to change their properties with Lua.

Depending on the pressed button we change the text of 
3 labels. One in the root template (red), one in a group 
(yellow) and one on a page in a pager (green).

The blue button uses handles to make the code more 
readable.
