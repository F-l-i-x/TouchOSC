## Example for sending keystrokes to TouchOSC Bridge by local messages and lua script

This was part of the native functionality of MK1, but is no longer available in MK2.
But it can still be achieved by sending certain OSC messages to TouchOSC Bridge as the functionality 
is still present in Bridge to provide compatibility with MK1.
This example shows you how. Everything is explained inside the template.
