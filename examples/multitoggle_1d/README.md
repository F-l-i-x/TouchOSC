## Multitoggle done with individual buttons

![multitoggle](preview_1.gif) 

A simple multitoggle derived from a copied control from TouchOSC Mk1. Each button can have its own and independent MIDI messages.
Not convenient, not scaleable but usable. Includes scripts to unset the other buttons for 'exclusive mode'.
